Case 3: Techlab Application

In this application we are making a application for the Techlab at the University of Applied sciences Rotterdam. 
It is an application to be able to borrow products in the Techlab via an App for android instead of filling in a form while being in the Techlab. 
This app will eventually improve the work-flow of the Techlab and will bring useful features for the admins, workers and users. Here are a few:
* Being able to see what is in stock.
* Being able to reserve certain items in the Techlab.
* See when you have to bring back your borrowed item.

This application is for a project on our school.
